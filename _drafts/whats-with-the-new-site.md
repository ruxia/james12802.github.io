Hello! As you should have noticed, things have changed around here - hopfully for the better. Apart from the nice new colour scheme and layout (thanks to [Matt Swanson][ms] for his awesome theme ["Lagom"][L]) this blog has changed from simple HTML pages with bootstrap css, to the increadebly powerful and yet simple [Jekyll][j]. Jekyll is a static blog generator, writen in Ruby (I know(and if you don't look left ;p))
