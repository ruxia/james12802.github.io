This September, I became a University student as did thousands others around the UK and the hundreds of thousand other across the globe. As [earlier stated][early], I went to the University of Kent in Canterbury.

## Arrivals Day
After not really packing for a whole week, it was a bit of a mad rush on the morning the of Saturday the 20th! My Mum helped me pack clothes and stuff I hadn't even thought of like loo roll, kitchen stuff and even socks! The campus opened for freshers at 8 and with us leaving at 2ish, we arrived there about half four. I signed in, collected my key fob and headed to my accommodation.

## Tyler Court
My accommodation was in one of the 3 Tyler Court blocks and as requested (due to my CFS/ME) I was on the ground floor.
