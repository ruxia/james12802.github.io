It's the classic line on the box of most of the electric toys of my childhood. "Batteries NOT included." [Python][py] is often said to be the language which comes with batteries inculded. And it does. 

#The batteries
The standard installation of Python (2.x and 3.x) comes loaded with extras like IDLE and the extensive Standard Libary. This libary contains everything (well nearly everything) from advanced maths to Internet Protocol processing to communicating with the OS and even importing [antigravity][ag] - these four only scratch the surface of what the libary contains.

#But
Yeah, there is a but.
