So, here it is. My "How to" on creating your very own Jekyll blog. Now, this is Windows so if you are on OSX or Linux there are official tutorials from [Jekyll][jkt] (and come, if youâ€™re on Linux you should know who to do this stuff ;p). 

##Prerequisites
Jekyll is built on Ruby - so naturally, Ruby is required. As I have [stated before][p], I know very little Ruby and as I am running Windows, it is not pre-installed. I went through various methods of installing Ruby and acquiring all the necessary Gems, but to no avail.

Fortunately for me, [Madhur Ahuja][ma] clearly knew the pain I was suffering and created an all-in-one download. ["PortableJekyll"][pj] as he calls it, contains everything:
* Ruby 2.0
* Ruby DevKit
* All the required Ruby Gems
* Python 2.7.5
* Git 1.8.3

Now the last two I had already, but all the Ruby stuff, setup and in one place is just awesome! To download "PortableJekyll" [click here][pjd] (it takes you to his dropbox).

##Installation
Once that zipped folder has downloaded, extract the contents using your favourite file archiver \*cough\* 7-zip \*cough\*.
