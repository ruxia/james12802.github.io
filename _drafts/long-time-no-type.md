Hey! Long time, no type. Where have you been? What have you been doing? And why havn't you posted anything in AGES!?

## Ages
Wow! April was my last post and quite a lot has changed since then. I returned to college after the easter break, with same high goal of 3 Distingtion Stars. As like the year before the staff were not prepared and assingments where given out in the wrong order or not even writen! Dispite this I finished the year with the amazing grade of D\*D\*D\*!! 

This is the BTEC equivelent of A\*A\*A\* so I'm feeling pretty great about this - not only did I reach my goal but I am also being awarded Kent's Scholarship of Academic Excellence which I feel is a great reward for doing so well.

## Priorities
To achive this high grade, I had to put in alot of effort and extra time. Unfortuently this ment other activites suffered. Sadly one of these was the Database a fellow student and I were creating for a local musician. We were both very disapointed to have to leave the project unfinsihed, but my University placement had to come first.

Parhaps, somtime in the near future, I may write a little post-mortem on the project and what went wrong (so others and (me) don't make the same mistakes).

## Summer
After breaking up just in time for my birthday in early July, I have had a lovely long and restful summer. I spent the majoirity of the summer recoving from the crazy college year, gaming and generaly tatking it easy. As I type this, summer is nearing the end with just a week untill I head off to Kent and the excitment of University life. Oh and the madness of freshers week!

## More?!
I really enjoy blogging and I have plenty more to type, so I will be updating this blog at least once a month (more or less depending on the quantity of course work) with both technology and Uninverstiy life from a computer scientist's prespective.

See you in the next one!
