I love IT. I am currently studing IT and I want to become a programmer. So, the next logical step in IT journey is to go university. There are so many universities in the UK and yet I could only apply to five, then they had to wittled down to just two choices - a firm and an isurance choice.

Thats a hell of a lot of pressure to put on someone to chose where they want to spend the next 3 (or more) years of their life.
