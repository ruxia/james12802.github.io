I love IT. I am currently studying IT and when I'm done, I want to become a programmer. So, the next logical step in my IT journey is to go university. There are so many universities in the UK and yet I could only apply to five, which then they had to whittled down to just two choices - a firm and an insurance choice.

That's a hell of a lot of pressure to put on someone to chose where they want to spend the next 3 (or more) years of their life. 

## UCAS
In the UK, potential university applicants have to go through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service - known as [UCAS][ucas]. The process usually begins towards the first year of Sixth form (I was about 17). About that time, you are encouraged to start thinking about what you want to study at uni and where. 

## Open Days
Once you have an idea of at least where you want to go - you need to book open days with the universities. These days are often held in the summer holidays and generally include a tour of the campus, accommodation and the course related facilities. When I was in the first year of Sixth form, I only looked at one university - the relativity local [University of East Anglia][uea].

## UEA
I went to the UEA open day as Norwich is only about 2 hours away, so it wouldn't be too long to drive home when I needed to and by this time I had decided to pursue a carer in IT, rather than [Forensic Science][fs]. UEA also have fairly reasonable entry requirements for their Computer Science course - ABB, as well as a foundation course. 

This foundation course had much lower entry requirements, allowing students who didn't do great at A-levels an extra year before the degree started for them to be brought up to speed on all things Comp Sci. 

## Results day
But things didn't go to plan. After sitting the exams for both Biology and Chemistry, I was quietly confident and thought I had passed - even going as far to hope for a B. But I shouldn't have been. Results day was awful. [Really horrible][rd].
