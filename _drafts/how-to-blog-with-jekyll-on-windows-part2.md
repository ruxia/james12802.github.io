Right, Part 2. In the first part we covered installing Jekyll and it's dependencies, changed the system's path variable and a super quick test to check that everything was working okay. In this part we create the actual Jekyll blog.
Now lets just double check that everything is properly installed.

## Check
Now I'm sure that it's all installed and working fine, but lets just check. Open up a terminal and enter:

    jekyll

And like last time it should print out basic info on Jekyll

![Jekyll][img-cmd-j]

(Oh, and that is powershell - I've just orangeified it ;p)

Now that we are sure that it's all installed and working, lets get on with it!
