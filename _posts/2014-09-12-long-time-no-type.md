Hey! Long time, no type. Where have you been? What have you been doing? And why haven't you posted anything in AGES!?

## Ages
Wow! April was my last post and quite a lot has changed since then. I returned to college after the Easter break, with same lofty goal of 3 Distinction Stars. Just like the year before, the staff were not prepared and assignments where given out in the wrong order or not even written! Dispite this I finished the year with the amazing grade of D\*D\*D\*!! 

This is the BTEC equivalent of A\*A\*A\* so I'm feeling pretty great about this - not only did I reach my goal but because of my hard work I am also being awarded Kent's Scholarship of Academic Excellence which I feel a just reward for working so bloody hard.

## Priorities
In order to achive this high grade, I had to put in a lot of effort and a lot of extra time. Unfortunately this meant other activities suffered. Sadly one of these was the database a fellow student and I were creating for a local musician. We were both very disappointed to have to leave the project unfinished, but my University placement had to come first.

Perhaps, sometime in the near future, I may write a little post-mortem on the project and what went wrong (so others and I don't make the same mistakes).

## Summer
After breaking up just in time for my birthday in early July, I had a lovely long and restful summer. I spent the majority of the summer recovering from the crazy college year, gaming and generally taking it easy. As I type this, summer is nearing the end with just a week until I head off to Kent and the excitement of University life. Oh and the madness of freshers week!

## More?!
I really enjoy blogging and I have plenty more to type, so I will be updating this blog at least once a month (more or less depending on the quantity of course work) with both technology stuff and University life from a computer scientist's perspective.

See you in the next one!
